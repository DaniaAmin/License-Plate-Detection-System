# License-Plate-Detection-System
This project proposes the development of an automated vehicle and license plate detection system designed to enhance surveillance, security, and monitoring operations. Using cutting-edge machine learning models and computer vision techniques, this system will accurately identify vehicles and their license plates from video feeds in real-time.
